# Take-home Project

## The Challenge

Build a real-time voice AI tutor using LiveKit. The project should have a backend that powers the voice agent and a frontend that lets a user talk to it.

The tutor can teach anything — pick a subject you find fun or interesting. Beyond getting the core voice interaction working, use your product sense to decide what features make this a great tutoring experience and tell us about your choices in the README.

Additionally, you must include a file workflow.md that describes your workflow for completing the project. Please list any AI tools, specific models, harnesses, etc as well as a description of how you use them. Be specific! We want to understand how you use AI in your workflow to make you a faster and more productive engineer.

You can sign up for a free LiveKit account at https://cloud.livekit.io.

Expected time: 2 hours. We value working software over polish.

## Requirements

- Runnable using docker and docker-compose.
- use Redis as a backing state store for conversations.

## What We're Looking For

- Working software — We require services to be run with docker + docker compose. We should be able to clone your repo, add a .env file, then build and run the project with docker compose. If we can't run your project, we cannot move forward.
- Clean architecture — Clear separation of concerns between session management, conversation handling, and the voice/AI layer.
- Tradeoff reasoning — Use your README to briefly explain key decisions you made and why.
- Scalability awareness — You don't need to build for millions of users, but your README should briefly address: What would you change if this needed to handle 10,000 concurrent sessions?

## Submission Format

Submit a zip file of your git repository (including the .git folder), uploaded directly to your application, containing:

1. All source code for frontend and backend.
2. PROMPT.md that contains this prompt exactly.
3. README.md with:
   - Architecture overview (a short paragraph or simple diagram).
   - Key design decisions and tradeoffs.
   - A brief note on how you'd scale the system.
4. .env.example listing every environment variable needed to run the project (e.g., LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET, LIVEKIT_URL, LLM API keys, etc.). We will create our own .env from this template to run your project.
5. The project must read all secrets and configuration from a .env file in the project root. No hardcoded keys.
6. workflow.md describing your workflow, AI tools used, specific models, harnesses, and how you use them.
7. A short video walkthrough of the interface and agent functioning

## Guidance

- Use AI tools freely. We encourage using Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or any AI assistant. Use agents and create custom skills/automations where it helps. We care about the result and your ability to leverage tools effectively — not whether you typed every line by hand.
- LiveKit has great docs. Start with their Agents quickstart — it covers setting up a Python or Node voice agent quickly.

Good luck — we're excited to see what you build.
